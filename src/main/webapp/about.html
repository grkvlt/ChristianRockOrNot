                <h1>About Christian Rock or Not</h1>

                <p>
                    A web application that presents rock lyrics, with christian terms changed to secular ones, and
                    challenges the viewer to decide if they are from a christian rock track or not. A running count
                    of correct guesses is maintained for each track, and is presented after the viewer has made their
                    choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uses the <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com/" class="link">MusixMatch API</a> to download lyrics and
                    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/sql-database/" class="link">Azure SQL Database</a>" to
                    store the results of guesses by users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web application is hosted on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/" class="link">Microsoft Azure</a>
                    and uses a Linix Virtual Machine running Tomcat to serve the pages and REST API, and an Azure
                    Application Gateway as the public endpoint and for SSL termination.

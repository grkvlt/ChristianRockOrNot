baby, what's wrong?
why are you troubled here within me?
deep inside my heart, my baby, what's wrong?
so my honey i do not see why you forgive me
do you need me? am i wise? am i strong?
So why, so why, so why, so why?

Your love is overdue, the time is at hand
The hourglass is running out of sand
Wake up, you're still asleep
Are you dreaming too much?
Imaginary lovers can't be touched, look my way

jesus, let me be
jesus, let me be your fantasy
jesus, do you want
jesus, do you want my love?

jesus, let me be
jesus, let me be your fantasy
jesus, let me be
The vision you've been dreaming of
